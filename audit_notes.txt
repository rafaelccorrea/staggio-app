AUDIT FINDINGS:

1. LOGO: staggio_logo.png (with text) and staggio_icon.png (icon only) exist in assets/images/
   - Logo has gradient purple-to-teal, house + S + sparkle design
   - Icon has same design in rounded square frame

2. AUTH PERSISTENCE: Auth flow looks correct - AuthCheckRequested checks token on startup.
   The issue is likely that flutter_secure_storage is working but the splash screen 
   transitions too fast before the check completes. The _initialCheckDone flag should handle it.
   Need to investigate if the token is actually being persisted properly.

3. FIREBASE: Not configured at all - no google-services.json, no firebase deps in pubspec
   Need: firebase_core, firebase_auth, google_sign_in

4. SPLASH SCREEN: Currently inline in main.dart (_SplashScreen class). Shows "S" letter 
   instead of actual logo PNG. Needs redesign with actual logo image.

5. APP ICONS: Default Flutter icons exist but are the default Flutter logo, not Staggio icon.
   Need flutter_launcher_icons to generate proper icons from staggio_icon.png.

6. LOGIN SCREEN: Current design is basic purple gradient with card form. 
   Google/Apple buttons are placeholders showing SnackBar "em breve".

7. STRIPE: plans_screen already has checkout integration code added in previous session.
   Need to add credit purchase packs.

8. BACKEND: Has /auth/login, /auth/register, /auth/me, /properties, /storage/upload, 
   /stripe/checkout, /stripe/portal endpoints.
